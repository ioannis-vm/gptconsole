Abstract:<div data-language="eng" data-ev-field="abstract">With consideration of seismic resilience, damage of nonstructural components (NSCs) attracts significant attentions. Most previous studies focused on dynamic behaviors of NSCs under horizontal excitations. Near-fault earthquakes, however, have strong vertical ground motion components, but few studies assessed their influence on seismic damage of NSCs. In this study, the seismic responses of unanchored NSCs under near-fault earthquakes with strong vertical components are investigated. Response history analyses of steel moment frames with different heights under near-fault earthquakes are performed and the derived floor acceleration responses are taken as the inputs of unanchored NSCs. The sliding and rocking responses of NSCs under horizontal and vertical excitations are used to quantify the influence of near-fault earthquake characteristics. The results highlighted that bidirectional excitations (horizontal & vertical) would elevate the uncertainty in the sliding demands of NSCs and more likely to induce the occurrence of overturning failures for slender NSCs. The relation between rocking demands of NSCs and common intensity measures like PFA would be weakened due to the presence of vertical excitations.<br/></div> &copy; 2023 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

Abstract:Recent earthquakes have demonstrated that the vertical component of ground motion can be damaging to building structural and nonstructural components. Recorded vertical accelerations from these recent earthquakes significantly exceed the vertical spectral demands used for seismic design prescribed in building codes in the United States. The focus of this paper is to determine, through non-linear time history analyses, the expected behavior of a code-compliant 3-story steel moment frame structure under vertical accelerations consistent with the design level earthquake intensity. This study differs from prior research because all components, including gravity elements, are explicitly modeled to capture potential non-linear behavior. Prior studies compared elastic demand-capacity ratios for some structural elements, which may not provide a meaningful measure of damage due to the high frequency nature of vertical response. Insights from the analysis are used to recommend future research needs.<br/> &copy; 11th National Conference on Earthquake Engineering 2018, NCEE 2018: Integrating Science, Engineering, and Policy.

Abstract:<div data-language="eng" data-ev-field="abstract">Recent shake table experimental work revealed that cold-formed steel (CFS) buildings exhibit excellent structural performance under high earthquake excitations; however, the reasons behind their considerable structural capacity are still unclear. This is due to the fact that the complex nonlinear response of CFS members and their interactions in a subsystem and, subsequently, in a system level are not well defined.Currently, in the AISI S400 North American Standard for Seismic Design of Cold-Formed Steel Structural Systems the seismic design of CFS framed structures is based on the lateral response of CFS framed shear walls and special moment frames, as the primary lateral load resisting elements. Experimental studies on the contribution of non-structural elements, such as gypsum sheathing, to the lateral response of the shear wall have revealed their potential. As such, the addition of non-structural gypsum to the shear wall component is included in the seismic design in Canada but with limitations about their applicability. In the USA, this lateral force resisting system is not specifically recognised but the benefit of gypsum is considered inherent in the system&rsquo;s over-strength factor. There is still great uncertainty regarding the behaviour of nonstructural elements and the capacity forces they may impose on the structure. Further, the importance of the diaphragm component as part of the lateral load resisting system distributing the lateral forces to the vertical lateral load resisting elements is evident. Nonetheless, at present the AISI S400 Standard includes limited design guidelines for CFS framed diaphragms for use in the USA, while no information is available for diaphragm design in Canada. This is to be expected given the minimal pre-existing research work available on CFS framed diaphragms.CFS joist framing sheathed with structural OSB panels is a typical diaphragm configuration found in the floors and roofs of CFS buildings; as such, an experimental program of OSB sheathed / CFS framed diaphragm configurations was launched at McGill University and is presented in this dissertation. The aim was to provide insight on the in-plane lateral response of these subsystems when subjected to monotonic and reversed cyclic loading. Experimental results underlined the dependency of the diaphragm&rsquo;s lateral response on screw spacing and size. The beneficial effect of panel edge blocking was also demonstrated. Moreover, the need to update the design guidelines available in the AISI S400 Standard was highlighted by means of a comparison of design and experimental shear strength and stiffness values.In order to explore the effect of non-structural components in a system and subsystem level, diaphragm configurations with non-structural gypsum ceiling and gypcrete flooring were tested as part of the diaphragm experimental program. The experimental results were incorporated in the floor and roof of a case-study two-storey CFS building, featuring diaphragms, shear walls and gravity walls with gypsum sheathing throughout the structure. A simplified 3D phenomenological numerical modeling approach was followed and verified using experimental data. Response history dynamic analyses results revealed the addition of gypsum sheathing and gravity walls throughout the wall-line as substantially increasing the lateral resistance of the structure. Although, the non-structural elements on the diaphragm increased its shear strength and stiffness, they had a minimal effect on the seismic response of the CFS building.Further investigation of the influence of the diaphragm's flexibility on a CFS building was realized by means of a parametric numerical study, where three diaphragm stiffness conditions were examined; flexible, semi-rigid and rigid. Non-structural components were kept throughout the wall-line of the building as a more realistic approach. The two-storey CFS building was subjected to a design basis earthquake in the USA in the two directions and to a suite of 20 ground motions representing seismic hazard in Montreal and Vancouver, Canada, in the flexible side of the building. Modal analysis results showed that the dynamic properties of the building are directly influenced by the diaphragm flexibility. Response history analyses results revealed reduction of the wall-line storey drifts with increase of the diaphragm flexibility; the level of that reduction is dependent on the input ground motion. The rigid diaphragm assumption for the building, used in design, was able to capture adequately the shear wall forces; however, it overestimated the wall-line storey drift ratios of the CFS building.

Abstract:Observation of damage caused by the recent Abruzzo earthquake on April 6th 2009 showed how local interaction between infills and RC structures can lead to soft-storey mechanisms and brittle collapses. Results of the present case study are based on observed damage caused by the earthquake in the zone of Pettino. Analytical model based on simulated design procedure was built up and time history analyses were employed to verify the causes of the structural collapse, as highlighted by observed damage. This failure mechanism was investigated taking into consideration all components of the ground motion. Nonlinear behavior of brick masonry infills was taken into account and two parametric hypotheses for infill mechanical properties were considered, given the uncertainties that typically characterize these nonstructural elements. Nonlinear modeling of infills was made by a three-strut macro-model aimed at considering both local and global interaction between RC frame and infills. Seismic input was characterized by the real signal registered during the mainshock near the case-study structure. Different shear capacity models were considered in the assessment. Analytical results seem to confirm with good approximation the likely collapse scenario that damage observation highlighted; the lack of proper detailing in the columns made the local interaction between infills and RC columns and the strong vertical component of the ground motion to be the main causes of the brittle failure. &copy; 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.<br/>

Abstract:<div data-language="eng" data-ev-field="abstract">This paper discusses the results of an experimental study aimed at evaluating the influence of the vertical ground motion component on the seismic performance of unreinforced brick-masonry buildings. The research was motivated by post-earthquake observations of significant structural damage in the vicinity of the fault, where horizontal and vertical ground motions are often strong and synchronized. Vertical accelerations can fluctuate gravity loads, which control the in-plane lateral load capacity of masonry piers and affect the out-of-plane overturning stability of thin walls. Such phenomena seem not to be sufficiently explained in existing literature, while experimental evidence is undoubtedly missing. Here, the damage potential of vertical accelerations was investigated through a series of multidirectional shake-table tests on full-scale structures under simulated near-source ground motions of increasing intensity. The experiments comprised three nominally identical building specimens subjected to the principal horizontal component alone, the horizontal component combined with the vertical one, and the full three-component ground motion. The buildings included structural/nonstructural elements (e.g., gables, chimneys, and parapets) sensitive to gravity load variations due to their low axial loads. Two different sets of three-component earthquake records were employed to assess the effects of both tectonic and induced seismicity scenarios. Overall, the vertical earthquake motion did not cause appreciable differences in the behavior of the buildings. Any influence on the strength and peak response of structural/nonstructural walls was marginal and non-systematic. Data and observations from these experiments add substantially to our understanding of the vertical acceleration effects on masonry structures.<br/></div> &copy; 2021 The Authors.

Abstract:<div data-language="eng" data-ev-field="abstract">This study addresses the modeling of different energy dissipation mechanisms for numerical prediction of the vertical acceleration demand in regular moment-resisting steel frame structures. One of the issues discussed is the consideration of viscous damping in the structural model. It is shown that well-established Rayleigh-damping may highly overestimate the damping of the vertical modes, resulting in much too low vertical acceleration response predictions. A study with different damping models provides an appropriate damping modeling strategy that leads to reasonable predictions of both horizontal and vertical frame acceleration demands. Another open question is the effect of inelastic material behavior on the vertical acceleration demand on the considered regular structures. The results of a shell model of a frame structure exposed to high intensity ground motion excitation demonstrate that inelastic material behavior has virtually no impact on the vertical acceleration demand, while structural inelasticity leaves the horizontal acceleration response significantly smaller compared to the elastic demand. This leads to the conclusion that common frame models that capture the inelastic horizontal response but behave elastic in the vertical direction are suitable for the computation of both the horizontal and vertical acceleration demand.<br/></div> &copy; 2022, The Author(s).

Abstract:<div data-language="eng" data-ev-field="abstract">This study investigates demands on acceleration-sensitive nonstructural components (NSCs) in code-compliant Special Concentrically Braced Frame (SCBF) and Special Moment Frame (SMF) structures. Previous studies have highlighted that the assumption of ASCE 7-16 for the ratio of Peak Floor Acceleration (PFA) to Peak Ground Acceleration (PGA) is overly conservative. In most previous studies, the results were based on generic analytical models with non-deteriorating structural behavior or recorded data from instrumented buildings subjected to ground motions that were significantly weaker than the design-level earthquakes. This study evaluates the acceleration demands on NSCs in 11 archetype buildings modeled using advanced techniques. The ground motions used elicit inelastic response in the frames at the level expected by ASCE 7-16 compliant designs. The study examines the effect of the ratio of NSC period to structural period, NSC damping ratio, and NSC vertical location on these demands. Results of this investigation are compared with the provisions of ASCE 7-16 and the recommendations of the recently completed effort by the Applied Technology Council 120 project (ATC-120), which are the basis for the seismic design requirements for nonstructural components in the forthcoming ASCE 7-22 standard. Equations for the PFA/PGA ratio and NSC amplification factor, which account for the dynamic characteristics of the buildings, are developed based on regression analysis of the generated data. Results of the analyses indicate that the formula recommended by ATC-120 for estimating PFA/PGA along the height of the structure, which includes building nonlinearity effects through a constant building ductility reduction factor, overestimates floor accelerations at the top floors but underestimates them in the lower floors of the archetypes considered. At the same time, results show that the NSC seismic design force equation recommended by ATC-120 is conservative for the SCBF archetypes, while it underestimates the NSC force demands in the SMFs.<br/></div> &copy; 2022 Elsevier Ltd

Abstract:Near-fault vertical ground motions tend to cause the amplification of seismic responses of nonstructural components in an isolated structure. To study the mechanism of dynamic response control for nonstructural components in the isolated structure under near-fault vertical ground motions, a model for the base isolated structure-nonstructural coupling system was established. The seismic response control effect of nonstructural components with the quasi zero stiffness of isolation system was analyzed by using the non-linear time history response analysis method. Based on the energy analysis method, the energy balance equation for the base isolated structure-nonstructural coupling system was established. The results show that when using the vertical quasi zero stiffness system, the seismic isolation efficiency of nonstructural components is remarkable for the base isolation system with different natural frequency. The vertical elastic recovery and damping energy of the seismic isolated structure model with quasi zero stiffness are much bigger than those of the base isolated structure with fixed nonstructural component system. It is beneficial to control near-fault vertical seismic responses of nonstructural components by setting reasonable damping ratio.<br/> &copy; 2019, Editorial Office of Journal of Vibration and Shock.

Abstract:Consideration of vertical seismic design loads is important for long-span structural systems, short-period structures, and for some nonstructural components in the buildings. To this end, seismic design codes utilize alternative approaches to define vertical design spectrum at different levels of complexity: either as a fraction of horizontal design spectrum or using a separate functional form having features different than the horizontal spectrum. In all cases, a consistency between the horizontal and vertical design spectral ordinates is sought. In this paper, we consider a set of modern seismic design codes, horizontal and vertical ground-motion datasets, as well as ground-motion predictive models (GMPMs) to assess the accuracy of code-based vertical design spectrum expressions. We compute horizontal and vertical spectra for different earthquake scenarios (magnitude-distance-soil condition combinations) from the selected horizontal and vertical GMPMs for comparisons with their code-based (idealized) counterparts. Besides that, we study the vertical spectrum behavior from observed ground-motion data. Our observations suggest that the vertical design spectrum formulations by current codes do not fully explain the actual vertical spectral acceleration trends. We discuss the possible reasons behind the misrepresentation of vertical spectrum by the current code approach and introduce our own expressions to compute horizontal spectrum consistent vertical design spectrum from a comprehensive simulated dataset of correlated vertical and horizontal spectral ordinates.<br/> &copy; 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Abstract:<div data-language="eng" data-ev-field="abstract">In past decade, earthquake disasters have seriously damaged nonstructural components, so it is very important to study their dynamic stability. However, the existing researches mainly focus on the dynamic stability of multistory and high-rise buildings, and there are still deficiencies in the analysis of dynamic stability of reticulated shell structures under earthquake action. This paper takes the 40 m span K8 single-layer spherical reticulated shell structure with practical engineering significance as the research object, we study its dynamic instability characteristics under earthquake action, and propose a dynamic stability judgment method. The influence of various parameters on the critical loads of emotional stability of reticulated shell structures is systematically analyzed, including the impact of horizontal seismic action, the vertical seismic activity, and the three-dimensional seismic movement, considering the influence of material elastoplasticity; the result of different seismic inputs, the effects of initial geometric imperfections; the effects of varying rise span-ratio. In this paper, to investigate the nonlinear time-history response analysis, we uses the finite-element package ABAQUS. We first analyze the rise-span ratio as the dynamic stability of 1/3 single-layer reticulated shell structure under the action of the El Centro (1940) earthquake to reveal the dynamic loss of reticulated shell structure under earthquake action stable feature. The practical method for determining the proposed dynamic stability has a clear physical meaning and a range of applications. Our findings highlight that the critical load for dynamic stability under horizontal earthquake action is significantly lower than vertical earthquake action, and the critical load is the lowest under three-dimensional earthquake action. Material elastoplasticity influences the critical loads for dynamic stability of reticulated shell structures under different ground motions. The critical load of dynamic stability of single-layer structures with a larger rise-span ratio is lower, while those with a smaller one is higher. The initial geometric defects of the structure should be considered in practical engineering applications. The reticulated shell structure with a larger rise-span ratio needs to consider the dynamic stability problem in the strong earthquake area.<br/></div> &copy; 2024 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract:<div data-language="eng" data-ev-field="abstract">Fragility function that defines the probability of exceedance of a damage state given a ground motion intensity (IM) is an essential ingredient of modern approaches to seismic engineering as the performance-based earthquake engineering methodology. Epistemic as well as aleatory uncertainties associated with seismic loads and structural behavior are usually taken into account to analytically develop such curves. However, structural analyses are time-consuming, requiring generally a high computational effort. Moreover, the conditional probability of failure is usually computed by regression analysis assuming predefined probability functions, like the log-normal distribution, without prior information on the real probability distribution. To overcome these problems, the artificial neural network (ANN) technique is used for the development of structural seismic fragility curves considering record-to-record variability and structural parameter uncertainties. In this respect, the following aspects are addressed in this paper: (a) implementation of an efficient algorithm to select IMs as inputs for ANN, selecting the most relevant ones; (b) derivation of surrogate models by using the ANN technique, c) computation of fragility curves with Monte Carlo Simulations method and verification of the validity. These methods enable the implicit treatment of uncertainty in either or both of ground motion intensity and structural properties without making any prior assumption about the probability function. This methodology is then applied to estimate the probability of failure of a nonstructural component (NSC), i.e., vertical tank, located on a typical three-dimensional industrial frame. First, an extensive sensitivity analysis on the ANN input parameters is performed (feature selection), identifying the type and number of seismic intensity measures (amplitude-based, frequency-based, and time-based IM). Then different surrogate models are derived investigating the number of hidden layers and parameters. A multiple stripe analysis is then performed on a nonlinear model of the structure, deriving the set of data for the ANN. Different training and test subsets are used to derive the surrogate model. Finally, a Monte Carlo simulation is performed to derive the fragility curves for the limit state considered. Finally, the risk assessment is obtained, evaluating the mean annual rate of failure of the NSC.<br/></div> Copyright &copy; 2022 by ASME.

Abstract:<div data-language="eng" data-ev-field="abstract">Among anti-seismic technologies, base isolation is a very effective means of mitigating damage to structural and nonstructural components, such as equipment. However, most seismic isolation systems are designed for mitigating only horizontal seismic responses because the realization of a vertical isolation system (VIS) is difficult. The difficulty is primarily due to conflicting isolation stiffness demands in the static and dynamic states for a VIS, which requires sufficient rigidity to support the self-weight of the isolated object in the static state, but sufficient flexibility to lengthen the isolation period and uncouple the ground motion in the dynamic state. To overcome this problem, a semi-active VIS, called the piezoelectric inertia-type vertical isolation system (PIVIS), is proposed in this study. PIVIS is composed of a piezoelectric friction damper (PFD) and a leverage mechanism with a counterweight. The counterweight provides an uplifting force in the static state and an extra inertial force in the dynamic state; therefore, the effective vertical stiffness of PIVIS is higher in the static state and lower in the dynamic state. The PFD provides a controllable friction force for PIVIS to further prevent its excessive displacement. For experimental verification, a shaking table test was conducted on a prototype PIVIS controlled by a simple controller. The experimental results well agree with the theoretical results. To further investigate the isolation performance of PIVIS, the seismic responses of PIVIS were simulated numerically by considering 14 vertical ground motions with different characteristics. The responses of PIVIS were compared with those of a traditional VIS and a passive system (PIVIS without control). The numerical results demonstrate that compared with the traditional and passive systems, PIVIS can effectively suppress isolation displacement in all kinds of earthquake with various peak ground accelerations and frequency content while maintaining its isolation efficiency. The proposed system is particularly effective for near-fault earthquakes with long-period components, for which it prevents resonant-like motion.<br/></div> &copy; 2020 Techno-Press, Ltd.

Abstract:Seismic isolation systems are widely recognized as beneficial for protecting both acceleration- and displacement-sensitive nonstructural systems and components. So-called adaptive isolation systems exhibit nonlinear characteristics that enable engineers to achieve various performance goals at different hazard levels. These systems have been implemented to control the horizontal response, but there has been limited research on seismic isolation for controlling the vertical response. Thus, this paper seeks to evaluate the merits of adaptive vertical isolation systems for components, specifically in nuclear power plants (NPPs). To do this, six vertical isolation systems are designed to achieve multiple goals. The systems consist of in-parallel configurations of linear and nonlinear springs and dampers, falling into three groups depending on the elements they combine: (1) linear springs and linear dampers (LSLD), (2) linear springs and nonlinear dampers (LSND), and (3) nonlinear springs and linear dampers (NSLD). To investigate the effectiveness of the systems, a stiff piece of equipment is considered at an elevated floor within an NPP. A set of 30 triaxial ground motions is used to investigate the seismic performance of the equipment. The peak isolation displacement and peak equipment acceleration are used to assess the effectiveness of the vertical isolation systems. While all systems significantly reduce the seismic accelerations on the equipment, the relatively simple LSLD and LSND systems exhibit superior performance over multiple hazard levels.<br/> &copy; 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract:The scope of this study is the quantification of vertical peak floor acceleration demands at column lines and along the length of beams of elastic moment-resisting steel frames subjected to recorded ground motions. These demands correlate with the maximum strength demands on rigid nonstructural components attached to a frame structure. Since it is commonly assumed that buildings behave flexibly in the horizontal direction and rigidly in the vertical direction, the assessment of vertical acceleration demands is typically not considered in most cases. The results of this study show that vertical peak floor accelerations can be up to five times larger than the vertical peak ground acceleration, in contrast to horizontal peak floor accelerations that are only up to two times larger than the horizontal peak ground acceleration for the numerical models used in this study. The most significant amplifications estimated in the vertical direction are found at the center of the girders. Further investigations of modified steel frames indicate that the story-wise mass distribution has an influence not only on the vertical acceleration demand, but also on the horizontal component of the response, though to a lesser degree. In contrast, the response in the vertical and horizontal direction is only slightly affected by an increase in the flexural stiffness of the beams. The results of this study strongly indicate that in steel frames it can be considered highly questionable to ignore the amplification of the vertical acceleration component along the height of the structure.<br/> &copy; 2019, The Author(s).

Abstract:Nonstructural components (NSCs) housed in building structures are subject to semi-narrow band excitations generated via filtering of the ground motion by the supporting building. NSC design forces are generally provided based on adopting a 5% NSC viscous damping ratio (&xi;<inf>C</inf>), whereas recent experiments illustrate that typical NSCs may exhibit &xi;<inf>C</inf> values substantially different, mostly lower, than 5%. This study introduces damping modification factors (DMFs) to adjust NSCs elastic seismic design forces for other &xi;<inf>C</inf> values. Elastic floor spectra with different &xi;<inf>C</inf> values are developed for floor motions obtained from several code-based designed buildings subjected to ground motion sets with different intensities. Numerical analyses illustrate that due to the narrow-band characteristic of building floor motions, applying conventional DMFs proposed for adjusting ground spectral ordinates may lead to the underprediction of floor spectral ordinates up to 55% for the range of &xi;<inf>C</inf> evaluated in this study. Assuming a value of &xi;<inf>C</inf>, the amplitude of the DMF for a building floor spectrum is primarily a function of the NSC tuning ratio. For example, for a given floor motion and a &xi;<inf>C</inf> value of 2%, the DMF can vary from 1.0 (for a non-tuning condition) to 1.6 (for a tuning condition). To a lesser extent, the DMF is also influenced by supporting building characteristics (e.g., the level of inelastic behavior, fundamental period, height, and lateral-force resisting system), the vertical location of the NSC in the building, and ground excitation characteristics. Practical expressions, which are developed through simple modifications of the prescribed ground spectra DMFs by ASCE/SEI 41-13, are proposed to estimate DMFs for elastic floor spectra.<br/> &copy; 2019, Springer Nature B.V.

Abstract:In this paper, vertical peak floor acceleration (PFA<inf>v</inf>) demands on elastic multistory buildings are statistically evaluated using recorded ground motions. These demands are applicable to the assessment of nonstructural components that are rigid in the vertical direction and located at column lines or next to columns. Hence, PFA<inf>v</inf> demands of the floor system away from column lines and their effects on nonstructural components are not addressed. This study is motivated by the questionable general assumption that typical buildings are considered to be relatively flexible in the horizontal (lateral) direction but relatively rigid in the vertical (longitudinal) direction. Consequently, only few papers address the evaluation of vertical component acceleration demands throughout a building, and there is no consensus on the relevance of vertical accelerations in buildings. The results presented in this study show that the vertical ground acceleration demands are amplified throughout the column line of a steel frame structure. This amplification is in many cases significant, depending on the vertical stiffness of the load-bearing system, damping ratio, and the location of the nonstructural component in the building. From these outcomes it can be concluded that the perception of a rigid-body response of the column lines in the vertical direction is highly questionable, and further research on this topic is required.

Abstract:This article examines the use of rocking steel braced frames for the retrofit of existing seismically deficient steel building structures. Rocking is also used to achieve superior seismic performance to reduce repair costs and disruption time after earthquakes. The study focuses on low-rise buildings for which re-centring is solely provided by gravity loads rather than added post-tensioning elements. Friction energy dissipative (ED) devices are used to control drifts. The system is applied to 2-storey and 3-storey structures located in 2 seismically active regions of Canada. Firm ground and soft soil conditions are considered. The seismic performance of the retrofit scheme is evaluated using nonlinear dynamic analysis and ASCE 41-13. For all structures, rocking permits to achieve immediate occupancy performance under 2% in 50&nbsp;years seismic hazard if the braces and their connections at the building's top storeys are strengthened to resist amplified forces due to higher mode response. Base shears are also increased due to higher modes. Impact at column bases upon rocking induces magnified column forces and vertical response in the gravity system. Friction ED is found more effective for drift control than systems with ring springs or bars yielding in tension. Drifts are sufficiently small to achieve position retention performance for most nonstructural components. Horizontal accelerations are generally lower than predicted from ASCE 41 for regular nonrocking structures. Vertical accelerations in the gravity framing directly connected to the rocking frame are however higher than those predicted for ordinary structures. Vertical ground motions have limited effect on frame response.<br/> Copyright &copy; 2017 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Abstract:<div data-language="eng" data-ev-field="abstract">Floor response spectra (FRS) are used to compute the design floor accelerations for seismic design of acceleration-sensitive non-structural components (NSCs) in a building. In the present study, the elastic FRS at different floor levels are investigated for a set of linear and nonlinear models of both low- and mid-rise reinforced concrete (RC) frame structures. The damping modification factors (DMFs) for the elastic FRS are derived for seven different damping ratios of the NSC's (i.e. 0.1%, 0.2%, 0.5%, 1%, 2%, 5%, and 10%), and six different levels of inelastic response in the building structure. It is observed that DMFs for the elastic FRS are influenced by both NSC and building structure characteristics. The factors affecting the DMFs for the elastic FRS include the damping ratio of the NSC, the tuning ratio (i.e. the ratio between the period of vibration of the NSC, T<inf>s</inf>, to the fundamental period of vibration of the building structure, T<inf>1</inf>), the modal periods (T<inf>1</inf> and T<inf>2</inf>), and the level of the building structure's inelasticity. Conversely, the vertical location of the NSC in the building structure does not affect DMFs significantly. Further, in the case of a tuned response of the NSC, the DMFs for elastic FRS are significantly higher for NSC damping ratios less than 5% and lower for NSC damping ratios greater than 5%, than those conventionally used for the elastic ground response spectra (GRS). This is true for the elastic response as well as for low levels of inelasticity in the building structure. On the other hand, at high levels of the building structure's inelasticity, the DMFs for elastic FRS approach to the conventional DMFs derived for the elastic GRS. Considering these observations, a design-oriented multilinear model is proposed to compute DMFs for the elastic FRS, accounting for the specific characteristics of the NSC (i.e. the period and the damping ratio of the NSC) and the building structure (i.e. the modal periods and the level of the inelasticity). The proposed model for computing the DMFs for elastic FRS is validated by comparing the model predictions with those obtained by time-history analyses, using a different RC frame building and an entirely different suite of ground-motion records than those that were used to develop the proposed model. The proposed model to compute DMFs for the elastic FRS can be used with both the current code-based and the performance-based seismic design of NSCs located in the inelastic building structures.<br/></div> &copy; 2021 Elsevier Ltd

Abstract:This paper addresses the statistical evaluation of vertical peak floor acceleration (PFA<inf>v</inf>) demands on elastic multistory buildings using recorded ground motions. Typical buildings are considered to be relatively flexible in the horizontal (lateral) direction and relatively rigid in the vertical (longitudinal) direction. The vast majority of studies conducted on the quantification of component acceleration demands have considered the flexibility of the nonstructural component (NSC) and its supporting structure primarily in the lateral direction. Studies on the evaluation of vertical component acceleration demands throughout a building are scarce and different opinions exist on the relevance of vertical accelerations in buildings. This paper focuses on the quantification of PFA<inf>v</inf>, which implies that NSCs are assumed to be rigid in the vertical direction. Only rigid NSCs located close to columns of moment-resisting frames are considered. Thus, the influence of vertical floor vibrations and their dependence on the properties of the floor system is not addressed. The results demonstrate that the amplification of vertical ground acceleration demands throughout a building depends on the vertical stiffness of the load bearing structure, and hence, the common assumption of rigid-body responses in the vertical direction is highly questionable.<br/>

Abstract:Seismic performance of posttensioned hybrid precast wall systems has been mainly studied in the past without considering the interaction of the wall system with the rest of the structure. In the present study, the multilevel seismic response of posttensioned hybrid precast wall-frame (PWF) buildings is evaluated using nonlinear response history analysis and compared with the response of shear wall-frame (SWF) buildings under unidirectional excitation. For that purpose, three-dimensional finite-element models of code-compliant 4- and 8-story PWF and SWF buildings designed with different frame shear ratios are considered. The performance of buildings is evaluated under spectrum-matched earthquake motions to represent two levels of shaking viz the design earthquake (DE) level and the risk-targeted maximum considered earthquake (MCE<inf>R</inf>) level. The effect of the vertical component of earthquake motion on the peak response indicators of both types of buildings is also studied. It is determined that the seismic performance of PWF buildings is superior to SWF buildings in terms of limiting structural damage under the DE-level and the MCE<inf>R</inf>-level ground motions, despite the relatively larger roof drifts observed in the PWF buildings; however, nonstructural damage caused by floor accelerations is more pronounced in the PWF buildings. In addition, it is determined that the inclusion of the vertical component of earthquake motion does not significantly affect the peak response indicators of the PWF and SWF buildings considered in this study.<br/> &copy; 2016 American Society of Civil Engineers.

Abstract:As a drift-sensitive nonstructural component, the in-plane deformation ability of the curtain wall (CW) in a tall building is critical to the seismic performance. The immediate earthquake excitation of the CW system is the floor response where the CW is located. To evaluate the drift demand of the outer-skin CW system of the Shanghai Tower, floor responses of the reinforced stories of each vertical zone are analyzed. Drift demands, including the interzone drift ratio (IDR) and interzone drift response spectrum (IDRS), are obtained to define the engineering demand parameters related to the in-plane relative displacement of the CW system. The results show that the 3-dimensional ground motion (GM) excitations generate larger heightwise IDR distribution profiles and larger IDRSs than the 1-dimensional GMs. The obtained IDR demands are shown to be 1/250, 1/150, and 1/100 for 3 key earthquake intensity levels. These values are different from those given by the current code provisions of China and other countries. The IDR distribution profiles of each vertical zone increase with height. The mean IDRSs of all 8 main vertical zones under selected GM excitations are determined as the representative drift spectra for each earthquake intensity level. Based on these mean spectra, simplified bilinear drift spectra are constructed for seismic design and analysis of the outer-skin CW system of the Shanghai Tower.<br/> Copyright &copy; 2017 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Abstract:Ground motion prediction equations (GMPEs) for elastic response spectra are typically developed at a 5% viscous damping ratio. In reality, however, structural and nonstructural systems can have other damping ratios. This paper develops a new model for a damping scaling factor (DSF) that can be used to adjust the 5% damped spectral ordinates predicted by a GMPE for damping ratios between 0.5% to 30%. The model is developed based on empirical data from worldwide shallow crustal earthquakes in active tectonic regions. Dependencies of the DSF on potential predictor variables, such as the damping ratio, spectral period, ground motion duration, moment magnitude, source-to-site distance, and site conditions, are examined. The strong influence of duration is captured by the inclusion of both magnitude and distance in the DSF model. Site conditions show weak influence on the DSF. The proposed damping scaling model provides functional forms for the median and logarithmic standard deviation of DSF, and is developed for both RotD50 and GMRotI50 horizontal components. A follow-up paper develops a DSF model for vertical ground motion.&copy; 2014, Earthquake Engineering Research Institute.<br/>

Abstract:A survey of 217 multistory buildings carried out following the 22 February 2011 Christchurch Earthquake further confirmed many of the known vulnerabilities vertical nonstructural components (VNSC) have to seismic movements. VNSC include facades, claddings, external infills, and internal partitions. In order to improve the seismic performance of such components, this paper will outline issues identified during damage reconnaissance following the Canterbury earthquake sequence. Displacement-based demands have been obtained using nonlinear response history analyses of a set of code-compliant, post-1990s reinforced concrete buildings when subjected to recorded ground motions of the major Canterbury earthquakes. The corresponding expected damage to VNSC based on informative guidance given in design codes and damage limits obtained experimentally are compared against the damage observed in post-earthquake assessments. &copy; 2014, Earthquake Engineering Research Institute.<br/>

Abstract:Severe damage to acceleration sensitive nonstructural components in recent earthquakes has resulted in unprecedented losses. Recent research has been aimed at increasing the understanding of acceleration demands on nonstructural components in buildings. This investigation subjects a set of four special moment resisting frame (SMRF) building models to a suite of 21 far-field ground motions using the incremental dynamic analysis procedure. Full three-dimensional models including floor slabs are used to extract both the horizontal and vertical responses. Floor acceleration response spectra are generated to assess the acceleration demands on elastic nonstructural components. Changes to the current code provisions that include the influence of structural period are proposed. An alternative design approach that directly amplifies the ground acceleration spectrum to achieve the desired floor acceleration spectrum is presented. &copy; 2013, Earthquake Engineering Research Institute.<br/>

Abstract:SUMMARY: Base isolation is a well known technology that has been proven to reduce structural response to horizontal ground accelerations. However, vertical response still remains a topic of concern for base-isolated buildings, perhaps more so than in fixed-base buildings as isolation is often used when high performance is required. To investigate the effects of vertical response on building contents and nonstructural components, a series of full-scale shaking table tests were conducted at the E-Defense facility in Japan. A four-story base-isolated reinforced concrete building was outfitted as a medical facility with a wide variety of contents, and the behavior of the contents was observed. The rubber base isolation system was found to significantly amplify vertical accelerations in some cases. However, the damage caused by the vertical ground motions was not detrimental when peak vertical floor accelerations remained below 2g with three exceptions: (1) small items placed on shelves slid or toppled; (2) objects jumped when placed on nonrigid furniture, which tended to increase the response; and (3) equipment with vertical eccentricities rocked and jumped. In these tests, all equipment and nonstructural components remained functional after shaking. &copy; 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.<br/>

Abstract:Design of base-isolated structures using the Equivalent Lateral Force procedure of ASCE 7 is limited to regular buildings with moderate ground motions. When the limits of the procedure are exceeded, nonlinear response history analysis is usually implemented to capture the dynamic interaction of the superstructure and the isolation system using site-specific ground motions. This paper provides an example of a hybrid approach for designing base-isolated structures by conducting a detailed nonlinear response history analysis of a simplified isolator-building system to generate an envelope of story forces to be used in the design of the building using a fixed-base, static analysis approach. This allows the engineer to take advantage of the potential reductions in base shear and maximum displacement permitted by a dynamic analysis while preserving the simplicity of a static analysis for design. The resulting vertical force distribution from the simplified model is also compared to the new vertical force distribution for isolated structures included in ASCE 7-16. Results of nonlinear response history analyses using the simplified isolator-building model provides the maximum isolator design displacement, forces for the design of the superstructure lateral system, and anchorage of nonstructural components. The analysis also applies tri-directional acceleration input (as a peer review requirement) in order to capture the vertical demands on the isolation system and building components, and the potential increase in lateral forces and accelerations due to coupled vertical-horizontal response of the selected isolator type. The system behavior using vertical excitation is compared to that of horizontal excitation only and both are compared to the proposed code vertical force distribution.<br/>

Abstract:A 5-story steel moment frame building was tested at E-Defense in August of 2011 with three different support configurations: supported by a triple friction pendulum isolation system, supported by lead rubber bearings in combination with cross linear bearings, and in the fixed-base condition. Nonstructural components and contents were installed on the 4th and 5th floors. The isolated buildings were subjected to strong excitations with the goal to approach the displacement limit of the baseisolation devices. The triple friction pendulum system was subjected to a variety of large ground motions, but did not reach its displacement limit as the friction was observed to be larger than during initial bearing characterization. The lead-rubber isolators were subjected simultaneously to large displacements and some tension. Nonstructural component damage and content disruption due to strong vertical excitation was observed in both isolation systems and in the fixed-base configuration. &copy; 2012 ASCE.<br/>

Abstract:Two moderate-size earthquakes occurred in the United Kingdom, the first near Folkestone in 2007 with M<inf>w</inf> 4.0 and the second near Market Rasen in 2008 with M<inf>w</inf> 4.5. Both were strongly felt and caused some nonstructural damage. The earthquakes occurred at significantly different depths, the Folkestone earthquake at 5 km and the Market Rasen earthquake at 20 km. We determined the seismic moment and the stress drop of the two mainshocks, and two smaller earthquakes in the same locations, by modeling the source displacement spectra. We found stress drops of 30 &plusmn; 34 bar and 344 &plusmn; 136 bar for the Folkestone and Market Rasen mainshocks, respectively. This is a significant difference considering the earthquakes are only 275 km apart and both are of intraplate origin. We applied the stochastic groundmotion modeling technique and used the stress drop and seismic moment to compute vertical component peak ground acceleration. The modeled ground motions are consistent with the observations. We also computed vertical peak ground acceleration for a hypothetical M<inf>w</inf> 6.0 high stress-drop (200 bar) earthquake and found that it would be 4:6 m/sec<sup>2</sup> at 20 km hypocentral distance.

Abstract:This paper is an attempt to determine the effect of vertical ground motion on design of precast concrete cladding panels in seismic regions, particularly in near-source areas. A spandrel-type precast concrete cladding panel is chosen for detailed study and assumed attached to a building in San Francisco. The seismic provisions of International Building Code 2000 and Uniform Building Code 1997 are used to determine the design forces on the cladding panel, which was originally designed as an example in a PCI publication. The provisions of the two codes are compared in light of their requirements related to vertical ground motion consideration and near-source effects. Results of recent research on the relation between vertical and horizontal ground acceleration components as a function of source-to-site distance are also used to illustrate an example of incorporating vertical spectral acceleration effects directly in load combinations. Finally, finite-element modeling and frequency analysis results of the spandrel and floor-to-floor types of cladding panel are discussed. This study shows that the effects of vertical ground motion will cause an increase in the design forces for connections of heavy cladding panels, especially in near-source regions, with the magnitude of the increase dependent on the source-to-site distance. &copy; ASCE.
